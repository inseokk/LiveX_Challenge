### How to Use

- Navigate to Home: Click the logo in the top-left corner.
- Browse Pages: Use the left sidebar to navigate to the Apps or Documents page.
- Open Chatbot: Click the chat icon in the bottom-right corner of the screen.
- Search: Use the search bar in the top-right corner to search content on the current page.


# Assumptions and Design Choices

I assumed that a landing page would be useful for users, as websites commonly lead back to a main page when the logo is pressed.
I also assumed that the search bar would only display corresponding results from the page that the user is currently on. This was to avoid confusion if the results happened to be on other pages. For an actual website with real information, it may be more convenient to display results from all different pages on the website. 

# Thought process and challenges

In creating this website, I laid down the basic structure and information of the website before going back to add css components and functionality. This allowed me to have an overarching view of the entire website while working.
Additionally, designing a clean and engaging user interface was a key challenge for me. Thus, I incorporated AI suggestions for the design especially when creating the chatbot interface. By utilizing gradients and rounded shapes, I was able to achieve a user-friendly design.


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
